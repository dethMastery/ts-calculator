# TS-Calculator

this might be `first package` that I used 'TypeScript' & 'Yargs' to make an NPM Package sorry for any buggy :(

# Installation

1. clone this project

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/dethMastery/ts-calculator.git
```

2. install package in this repo

```zsh
cd ts-calculator
yarn
```

3. now its ready :)

```zsh
yarn dev <1st number> <operator> <2nd Number>
```

If you not sure obout operator, just run `yarn dev` to see a little help from me :)
